# Contributing to Aureus

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Aureus as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Individual Contributions

Here's a breakdown of the key contributions by the project team members:

*   **Shreyash Raj Bamrara:** Developed the AI advisor/chatbot, created the various graphs and visualizations, and built the data preprocessing module.
*   **Daksh Gautam:** Responsible for the frontend development and integrating the different components into the final application.
*   **Manas Nautiyal:** Completed the anomaly detection and forecasting parts of the system.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/ShreyashRajBamrara/AureusTwo/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ShreyashRajBamrara/AureusTwo/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

* Use 4 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
* Keep line length under 100 characters
* Run `flake8` for style enforcement
